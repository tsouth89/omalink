# OmaLink

Your Android phone, native to Omarchy.

OmaLink is a themed Omarchy Shell plugin powered by KDE Connect. It puts the
phone controls and information that matter directly in the bar, without a web
account or cloud relay.

## Features

- Connected phone, battery, charging state, network type, and signal strength
- Android notifications with dismissal on the phone, one by one or all at once
- Quick reply to notifications from messaging apps
- Open a text's conversation straight from its notification
- SMS conversation list with contact names, search, and unread state
- Read conversations, copy message text, send replies, and start new messages
- MMS photos inline, with a full-size viewer, save to Downloads, and open
  actions; videos and other attachments open in their default app
- Send the desktop clipboard to the phone
- Send text or links to the phone
- Ring a misplaced phone
- Native colors and typography across Omarchy themes
- Memory-only message cache that is cleared when the message window closes

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4.0 or newer
- An Android phone with [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) installed
- `kdeconnect` and `jq` on the Omarchy computer

## Install

Install and enable OmaLink:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/tsouth89/omalink.git --enable
```

If KDE Connect is not installed yet:

```sh
omarchy pkg add kdeconnect
```

Open OmaLink from the bar, choose **Open pairing**, and approve the computer in
KDE Connect on your phone. Grant the Android permissions needed for messaging,
contacts, notifications, clipboard access, and device status.

Both devices must be able to reach one another, normally on the same local
network.

## Messaging notes

OmaLink uses KDE Connect's Android messaging interface. It can read SMS/MMS
conversation history, send SMS messages, and show that a message contains an
attachment. Sending attachments and RCS are not currently exposed by KDE
Connect.

Message history is requested from the phone when needed. OmaLink does not add
its own cloud service or persistent message database.

## Development

Run the checks:

```sh
omarchy plugin validate .
node tests/model.test.js
bash tests/cli.test.sh
```

The test suite uses mock phone data and does not send messages.

## Roadmap

- Guided setup and permission diagnostics
- File sending
- Notification replies
- Event-driven message and media updates
